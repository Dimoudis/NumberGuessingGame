# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java console application where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.

## How it works

1. The program generates a random target number from 1 to 100.
2. The player enters guesses through the console.
3. After each guess, the program tells the player if the number is too high, too low, or correct.
4. The game counts the number of attempts and displays it when the player guesses correctly.

## Future improvements

- Implementing a replay feature.
- Adding more advanced programming features.
